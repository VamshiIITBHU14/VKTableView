# VKTableView
Hello All!
I was working on an app where I had to show information about 10-12 different entities and each entity details are </br>
to be shown in a UICollectionView. Thought of adding some fancy element and I came up with this project. </br>
Would love your feedback. Please have a look at GIF attached to have a better idea of what I have come up with.</br> 

This project covers:</br>

1) Compress bigger sized images and put in a nice UICollectionView with parallax effect. </br>
2) It also covers adding a fancy expanding cell to UICollectionView, several auto layout-based labels, subtle parallax effects, and fading transitions to a standard Collection View. 
3) Animating Autolayout Constraints with nice spring effects.

Written in Swift 4 Syntax.
